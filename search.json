    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper introduces the concept of a non-cooperative game and develops methods for the mathematical analysis of such games. The games considered are n-person games represented by means of pure strategies and pay-off functions defined for the combinations of pure strategies.\nThe distinction between cooperative and non-cooperative games is unrelated to the mathematical description by means of pure strategies and pay-off functions of a game. Rather, it depends on the possibility or impossibility of coalitions, communication, and side-payments.\nThe concepts of an equilibrium point, a solution, a strong solution, a sub-solution, and values are introduced by mathematical definitions. And in later sections the interpretation of those concepts in non-cooperative games is discussed.\nThe main mathematical result is the proof of the existence in any game of at least one equilibrium point. Other results concern the geometrical structure of the set of equilibrium points of a game with a solution, the geometry of sub-solutions, and the existence of a symmetrical equilibrium point in a symmetrical game.\nAs an illustration of the possibilities for application a treatment of a simple three-man poker model is included.",

    "text": "Von Neumann and Morgenstern have developed a very fruitful theory of two-person zero-sum games in their book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior [1]. This books also contains a theory of n-person games of a type which we would call cooperative. This theory is based on an analysis of the interrelationships of the various coalitions which can be formed by the players of the game.\nOur theory, in contradistinction, is based on the absence of coalitions in that it is assumed that each participant acts independently, without collaboration or communication with any of the others.\nThe notion of an equilibrium point is the basic ingredient in our theory. This notion yields a generalization of the concept of the solution of a two-person zero-sum game. It turns out that the set of equilibrium points of a two-person zero-sum game is simply the set of all pairs of opposing “good strategies”.\nIn the immediately following sections we shall define equilibrium points and prove that a finite non-cooperative game always has at least one equilibrium point. We shall also introduce the notions of solvability and strong solvability of a non-cooperative game and prove a theorem on the geometrical structure of the set of equilibrium points of a solvable game.\nAs an example of the application of our theory we include a solution of a simplified three person poker game.\nThe motivation and interpretation of the mathematical concepts employed in the theory are reserved for discussion on a special section of this paper.\n\n\n\n\n[1] J.

    "text": "In this section we define the basic concepts of this paper and set up standard terminology and notation. Important definitions will be preceded1 by a subtitle2 indicating the concept defined3. The non-cooperative idea will be implicit, rather than explicit, below.\nWe write \\(s_i=\\sum_{\\alpha} c_{i\\alpha} \\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) with \\(\\sum_{\\alpha } c_{i\\alpha}=1\\) and \\(c_{i\\alpha} \\geq 0\\) to represent such a mixed strategy, where the \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\)’s are the pure strategies of player \\(i\\). We regard the \\(s_i\\)’s as points in a simplex whose vertices are the \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\)’s. This simplex may be regarded as a convex subset of a real vector space, giving us a natural process of linear combination for the mixed strategies.\nWe shall use the suffixes \\(i,j,k\\) for players and \\(\\alpha ,\\beta ,\\gamma\\) to indicate various pure strategies of a player. The symbols \\(s_i, t_i\\) and \\(r_i\\), etc. will indicate mixed strategies; \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) will indicate the \\(i^{th}\\) player’s \\(\\alpha^{th}\\) pure strategy, etc.\nWe shall write \\(\\symscr{s}\\) or \\(\\symscr{t}\\) to denote an n-tuple of mixed strategies and if \\(\\symscr{s} = (s_1, \\cdots,s_n)\\) then \\(p_i(\\symscr{s})\\) shall mean \\(p_i(s_1, s_2, \\cdots, s_n)\\). Such an n-tuple, \\(\\symscr{s}\\), will also be regarded as a point in a vector space, which space could be obtained by multiplying together the vector spaces containing the mixed strategies. And the set of all such n-tuples forms, of course, a convex polytope, the product of the simplices representing the mixed strategies.\nFor convenience we introduce the substitution notation \\((\\symscr{s}; t_i)\\) to stand for \\((s_1, s_2, \\cdots, s_{i-1}, t_i, s_{i+1}, \\cdots, s_n)\\) where \\(\\symscr{s} = (s_1, s_2, \\cdots, s_n)\\). The effect of successive substitutions \\(((\\symscr{s}; t_i); r_j)\\) we indicate by \\((\\symscr{s}; t_i; r_j)\\), etc.\nThus an equilibrium point is an n-tuple \\(\\symscr{s}\\) such that each player’s mixed strategy maximizes his pay-off if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player’s strategy is optimal against those of the others. We shall occasionally abbreviate equilibrium point by eq. pt.\nWe say that a mixed strategy \\(s_i\\) uses a pure strategy \\(\\pi_{i\\beta}\\) if \\(s_i = \\sum_{\\alpha} c_{i\\alpha} \\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) and \\(c_{i\\beta}&gt;0\\). If \\(\\symscr{s} = (s_1, s_2,\\cdots, s_n)\\) and \\(s_i\\) uses \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) we also say that \\(\\symscr{s}\\) uses \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\).\nFrom the linearity of \\(p_i(s_1, \\cdots, s_n)\\) in \\(s_i\\),\n\\[\n\\max_{\\text{all } r_i\\text{'s}} [p_i(\\symscr{s}; r_i)] = \\max_{\\alpha} [p_i(\\symscr{s}; \\pi_{i\\alpha})].\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nWe define \\(p_{i\\alpha}(\\symscr{s}) = p_i(\\symscr{s}; \\pi_{i\\alpha})\\). Then we obtain the following trivial necessary and sufficient condition for \\(\\symscr{s}\\) to be an equilibrium point:\n\\[\np_i(\\symscr{s}) = \\max_{\\alpha} p_{i\\alpha}(\\symscr{s}).\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nIf \\(\\symscr{s} = (s_1, s_2, \\cdots, s_n )\\) and \\(s_i = \\sum_{\\alpha } c_{i\\alpha} \\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) then \\(p_i(\\symscr{s}) = \\sum_{\\alpha} c_{i\\alpha} p_{i\\alpha}(\\symscr{s})\\), consequently for 2.3 to hold we must have \\(c_{i\\alpha} = 0\\) whenever \\(p_{i\\alpha}(\\symscr{s}) &lt; \\max_{\\beta} p_{i\\beta}(\\symscr{s})\\), which is to say that \\(\\symscr{s}\\) does not use \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) unless it is an optimal pure strategy for player \\(i\\). So we write\n\\[\n\\text{if } \\pi_{i\\alpha} \\text{ is used in } \\symscr{s} \\text{ then } p_i(\\symscr{s}) = \\max_{\\beta} p_{i\\beta}(\\symscr{s})  \n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nas another necessary and sufficient condition for an equilibrium point.\nSince a criterion 2.3 for an eq. pt. can be expressed as the equating of two continuous functions on the space of n-tuples \\(\\symscr{s}\\) the eq. pts. obviously form a closed subset of this space. Actually, this subset is formed from a number of pieces of algebraic varieties, cut out by other algebraic varieties.",

For the \\(\\symscr{t}\\)’s whose components are all undominated are all that need be considered and this eliminating some of the strategies of one player may make possible the elimination of a new class of strategies for another player.\nAnother procedure which may be used in locating equilibrium points is the contradiction-type analysis. Here one assumes that an equilibrium point exists having component strategies lying within certain regions of the strategy spaces and proceeds to deduce further conditions which must be satisfied if the hypothesis is true.

    "text": "In this section we shall try to explain the significance of the concepts introduced in this paper. That is, we shall try to show how equilibrium points and solutions can be connected with observable phenomena.\nThe basic requirements for a non-cooperative game is that there should be no pre-play communication among the players [unless it has no bearing on the game]. Thus, by implication, there are no coalitions and no side-payments. Because there is no extra-game utility [pay-off] transfer, the pay-offs of different players are effectively incomparable; if we transform the pay-off functions linearly: \\(p_i' = a_ip_i + b_i\\), where \\(a_i &gt; 0\\) the game will be essentially the same. Note that equilibrium points are preserved under such transformations.\nWe shall now take up the “mass-action” interpretation of equilibrium points. In this interpretation solutions have no great significance. It is unnecessary to assume that the participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. But the participants are supposed to accumulate empirical information on the relative advantages of the various pure strategies at their disposal.\nTo be more detailed, we assume that there is a population [in the sense of statistics] of participants for each position of the game. Let us also assume that the “average playing” of the game involves n participants selected at random from the n populations, and that there is a stable average frequency with which each pure strategy is employed by the “average member” of the appropriate population.\nSince there is to be no collaboration between individuals playing in different positions of the game, the probability that a particular n-tuple of pure strategies will be employed in a playing of the game should be the product of the probabilities indicating the chance of each of the n pure strategies to be employed in a random playing.\nLet the probability that \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) will be employed in a random playing of the game be \\(c_{i\\alpha}\\), and let \\(s_i = \\sum_{\\alpha} c_{i\\alpha} \\pi_{i\\alpha}\\), \\(\\symscr{s} = (s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n)\\). Then the expected pay-off to an individual playing in the \\(i^{th}\\) position of the game and employing the pure strategy \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) is \\(p_i(\\symscr{s}; \\pi_{i\\alpha}) = p_{i\\alpha}(\\symscr{s})\\).\nNow let us consider what effects the experience of the participants will produce. To assume, as we did, that they accumulated empirical evidence on the pure strategies at their disposal is to assume that those playing in position \\(i\\) learn the numbers \\(p_{i\\alpha}(\\symscr{s})\\). But if they know these they will employ only optimal pure strategies, i.e, those pure strategies \\(\\pi_{i\\alpha}\\) such that\n\\[\np_{i\\alpha}(\\symscr{s}) = \\max_{\\beta} p_{i\\beta}(\\symscr{s}).\n\\]\nConsequently since \\(s_i\\) expresses their behavior \\(s_i\\) attaches positive coefficients only to optimal pure strategies, so that\n\\[\n\\pi_{i\\alpha} \\text{ is used in } s_i \\implies p_{i\\alpha}(\\symscr{s}) = \\max_{\\beta} p_{i\\beta}(\\symscr{s}).\n\\]\nBut this is simply a condition for \\(\\symscr{s}\\) to be an equilibrium point. [see 2.4, pg. 4]\nThus the assumptions we made in this “mass-action” interpretation lead to the conclusion that the mixed strategies representing the average behavior in each of the populations form an equilibrium point.\nThe populations need not be large if the assumptions still make it: … [?]ill hold1. There are situations in economics or international politics in which, effectively, a group of interests are involved in a non-cooperative game without being aware of it; the non-awareness helping to make the situation truly non-cooperative.\nActually, of course, we can only expect some sort of approximate equilibrium, since the information, its utilization, and the stability of the average frequencies will be imperfect.\nWe now sketch another interpretation, one in which solutions play a major role, and which is applicable to a game played but once.\nWe proceed by investigating the question: what would be a “rational” prediction of the behavior to be expected of rational playing the game in question? By using the principles that a rational prediction should be unique, that the players should be able to deduce and make use of it, and that such knowledge on the part of each player of what to expect the others to do should not lead him to act out of conformity with the prediction, one is led to the concept of a solution defined before.\nIf \\(S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n\\) were the sets of equilibrium strategies of a solvable game, the “rational” prediction should be: “The average behavior of rational men playing in position \\(i\\) would define a mixed strategy \\(s_i\\) in \\(S_i\\) if an experiment were carried out.”\nIn this interpretation we need to assume the players know the full structure of the game in order to be able to deduce the prediction for themselves. It is quite strongly a rationalistic and idealizing interpretation.\nIn an unsolvable game it sometimes happens that good heuristic reasons can be found for narrowing down the set of equilibrium points to those in a single sub-solution, which then plays the role of a solution.\nIn general a sub-solution may be looked at as a set of mutually compatible equilibrium points, forming a coherent whole. The sub-solutions appear to give a natural subdivision of the set of equilibrium points of a game.",

    "text": "The study of n-person games for which the accepted ethics of fair play imply non-cooperative playing is, of course, an obvious direction in which to apply this theory. And poker is the most obvious target. The analysis of a more realistic poker game than our very simple model should be quite an interesting affair.\nThe complexity of the mathematical work needed for a complete investigation increases rather rapidly, however, with increasing complexity of the game; so that it seems that analysis of a game much more complex than the example given here would only be feasible using approximate computational methods.\nA less obvious type of application is the study of cooperative games. By a cooperative game we mean a situation involving a set of players, pure strategies, and pay-offs as usual; but with the assumption that the players can and will collaborate as they do in the von Neumann and Morgenstern theory. This means the players may communicate and form coalitions which will be enforced by an umpire. It is unnecessarily restrictive, however, to assume any transferability, or even comparability of the pay-offs [which should be in utility units] to different players. Any desired transferability can be put into the game itself instead of assuming it possible in the extra-game collaboration.\nThe writer has developed a “dynamical” approach to the study of cooperative games based upon reduction to non-cooperative form. One proceeds by constructing a model of the pre-play negotiation so that the steps of negotiation become moves in a larger non-cooperative game [which will have an infinity of pure strategies] describing the total situation.\nThis larger game is then treated in terms of the theory of this paper [extended to infinite games] and if values are obtained they are taken as the values of the cooperative game. Thus the problem analyzing a cooperative game becomes the problem of obtaining a suitable, and convincing, non-cooperative model for the negotiation.\nThe writer has, by such a treatment, obtained values for all finite two person cooperative games, and some special n-person games.",
