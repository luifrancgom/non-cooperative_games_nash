This repository contains a modern re-edition of John Forbes Nash Jr.'s thesis, **Non-Cooperative Games**, authored using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

The project is based in part on the LaTeX code by [Simon Xiang](https://github.com/simonxiang1/nash_thesis).

The original manuscript is currently in the public domain and can be accessed via the [Princeton University Library](https://library.princeton.edu/); it is also included in the `facsimile` folder.

The following additional sources were also consulted when creating the Quarto version (See @nash_non-cooperative_1951 and @nash_essential_2002):

## 🛠 Build from Source

To generate the thesis locally, ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) version `4.5.2` or later and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/download/) installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following commands to download the code and enter the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luifrancgom/non-cooperative_games_nash.git
cd non-cooperative_games_nash
```

### Install Dependencies

To render the PDF version, you need a LaTeX distribution. If you do not have one installed, Quarto can set up a lightweight version (TinyTeX) for you:

```bash
quarto install tinytex
```
Additionally, you must restore the R environment. Open R and run the following commands to install `renv` and synchronize the project dependencies:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```
Then, verify that the project environment is correctly synchronized:

```r
renv::status()
```

### Render the Book

Once the dependencies are ready, you can render all formats (HTML and PDF) with a single command:

```bash
quarto render
```
### Accessing Intermediate Files

By default, Quarto cleans up intermediate files after rendering. If you want to inspect the generated `.tex` (LaTeX) or `.md` (Markdown) source files, you must modify the `_quarto.yml` configuration file. 

Uncomment (or add) the following options under the pdf format section:

```yaml
format:
  pdf:
    keep-md: true
    keep-tex: true
```
After saving the changes to `_quarto.yml`, run `quarto render` again. The files will then remain in your project directory for you to access.
