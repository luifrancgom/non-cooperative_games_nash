# Formal Definitions and Terminology

In this section we define the basic concepts of this paper and set up standard terminology and notation. Important definitions will be preceded[^footnote-chapter2-1] by a subtitle[^footnote-chapter2-2] indicating the concept defined[^footnote-chapter2-3]. The non-cooperative idea will be implicit, rather than explicit, below.

[^footnote-chapter2-1]: The original spelling "preceeded" has been updated to "preceded" in this [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) version.
[^footnote-chapter2-2]: The original hyphenated "sub-title" has been rendered as "subtitle" to improve readability in this [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) version. 
[^footnote-chapter2-3]: Definitions are highlighted explicitly in this [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) version.

::: {#def-finite-game}
## Finite Game

For us an [n-person game]{.underline} will be a set of n [players]{.underline}, or [positions]{.underline}, each with an associated finite set of [pure strategies]{.underline}; and corresponding to each player, $i$, a [pay-off function]{.underline}, $p_i$, which maps the set of all n-tuples of pure strategies into the real numbers. When we use the term [n-tuple]{.underline} we shall always mean a set of n items, with each item associated with a different player.
:::

::: {#def-mixed-strategy}
## Mixed Strategy, $s_i$

A [mixed strategy]{.underline} of player $i$ will be a collection of non-negative numbers which have unit sum and are in one to one correspondence with his pure strategies.
:::

We write $s_i=\sum_{\alpha} c_{i\alpha} \pi_{i\alpha}$ with $\sum_{\alpha } c_{i\alpha}=1$ and $c_{i\alpha} \geq 0$ to represent such a mixed strategy, where the $\pi_{i\alpha}$'s are the pure strategies of player $i$. We regard the $s_i$'s as points in a simplex whose vertices are the $\pi_{i\alpha}$'s. This simplex may be regarded as a convex subset of a real vector space, giving us a natural process of linear combination for the mixed strategies.

We shall use the suffixes $i,j,k$ for players and $\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma$ to indicate various pure strategies of a player. The symbols $s_i, t_i$ and $r_i$, etc. will indicate mixed strategies; $\pi_{i\alpha}$ will indicate the $i^{th}$ player's $\alpha^{th}$ pure strategy, etc.

::: {#def-pay-off-function}
## Pay-off-function, $p_i$

The pay-off function, $p_i$, used in the definition of a finite game above, has a unique extension to the n-tuples of mixed strategies which is linear in the mixed strategy of each player \[n-linear\]. This extension we shall also denote by $p_i$, writing $p_i(s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n)$.
:::

We shall write $\symscr{s}$ or $\symscr{t}$ to denote an n-tuple of mixed strategies and if $\symscr{s} = (s_1, \cdots,s_n)$ then $p_i(\symscr{s})$ shall mean $p_i(s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n)$. Such an n-tuple, $\symscr{s}$, will also be regarded as a point in a vector space, which space could be obtained by multiplying together the vector spaces containing the mixed strategies. And the set of all such n-tuples forms, of course, a convex polytope, the product of the simplices representing the mixed strategies.

For convenience we introduce the substitution notation $(\symscr{s}; t_i)$ to stand for $(s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_{i-1}, t_i, s_{i+1}, \cdots, s_n)$ where $\symscr{s} = (s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n)$. The effect of successive substitutions $((\symscr{s}; t_i); r_j)$ we indicate by $(\symscr{s}; t_i; r_j)$, etc.

::: {#def-equilibrium-point}
## Equilibrium point

An n-tuple $\symscr{s}$ is an [equilibrium point]{.underline} if and only if for every $i$

$$
p_i(\symscr{s}) = \max_{\text{all } r_i\text{'s}} [p_i(\symscr{s}; r_i)].
$$ {#eq-equation-chap2-1}
:::

Thus an equilibrium point is an n-tuple $\symscr{s}$ such that each player's mixed strategy maximizes his pay-off if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player's strategy is optimal against those of the others. We shall occasionally abbreviate equilibrium point by eq. pt.

We say that a mixed strategy $s_i$ [uses]{.underline} a pure strategy $\pi_{i\beta}$ if $s_i = \sum_{\alpha} c_{i\alpha} \pi_{i\alpha}$ and $c_{i\beta}>0$. If $\symscr{s} = (s_1, s_2,\cdots, s_n)$ and $s_i$ uses $\pi_{i\alpha}$ we also say that $\symscr{s}$ uses $\pi_{i\alpha}$.

From the linearity of $p_i(s_1, \cdots, s_n)$ in $s_i$,

$$
\max_{\text{all } r_i\text{'s}} [p_i(\symscr{s}; r_i)] = \max_{\alpha} [p_i(\symscr{s}; \pi_{i\alpha})].
$$ {#eq-equation-chap2-2}

We define $p_{i\alpha}(\symscr{s}) = p_i(\symscr{s}; \pi_{i\alpha})$. Then we obtain the following trivial necessary and sufficient condition for $\symscr{s}$ to be an equilibrium point:

$$
p_i(\symscr{s}) = \max_{\alpha} p_{i\alpha}(\symscr{s}).
$$ {#eq-equation-chap2-3}

If $\symscr{s} = (s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n )$ and $s_i = \sum_{\alpha } c_{i\alpha} \pi_{i\alpha}$ then $p_i(\symscr{s}) = \sum_{\alpha} c_{i\alpha} p_{i\alpha}(\symscr{s})$, consequently for @eq-equation-chap2-3 to hold we must have $c_{i\alpha} = 0$ whenever $p_{i\alpha}(\symscr{s}) < \max_{\beta} p_{i\beta}(\symscr{s})$, which is to say that $\symscr{s}$ does not use $\pi_{i\alpha}$ unless it is an optimal pure strategy for player $i$. So we write

$$
\text{if } \pi_{i\alpha} \text{ is used in } \symscr{s} \text{ then } p_i(\symscr{s}) = \max_{\beta} p_{i\beta}(\symscr{s})  
$$ {#eq-equation-chap2-4}

as another necessary and sufficient condition for an equilibrium point.

Since a criterion @eq-equation-chap2-3 for an eq. pt. can be expressed as the equating of two continuous functions on the space of n-tuples $\symscr{s}$ the eq. pts. obviously form a closed subset of this space. Actually, this subset is formed from a number of pieces of algebraic varieties, cut out by other algebraic varieties.
